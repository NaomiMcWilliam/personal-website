          * Developed a Neural Network that takes several stellar activity              indicators as inputs (total solar irradiance, cross-correlation
            functions, unsigned magnetic flux etc.) and predicts the radial             velocity (RV) of the Sun.
          * Implemented the Neural Network using TensorFlow in Python.                  Performed pre-processing of input data. Used thorough
            methods to optimise the Neural Network and evaluate its                     performance.
          * Extended on work by de Beurs, Zoe. L. et al. (Aug. 2022).                   “Identifying Exoplanets with Deep Learning. IV. Re-moving
            Stellar Activity Signals from Radial Velocity Measurements Using             Neural Networks”. In: 164.2, 49, p. 49.
          * Reduced RV scatter from 154.7 cm/s to 92.1 cm/s. This is a                  step to reducing RV precision down to 10 cm s−1 to detect                   exoplanets.
          * Submitted to Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.
          * Presented two talks on my methods, the impacts of my findings,              and the #goals we are working towards for extreme precision                 radial velocity measurements.

          * Working with Professor Claudia de Rham on ’Black Holes in                   Massive Gravity’. Massive Gravity is a variation on General
            Relativity, with the graviton being massive.
          * Produced a literature review on General Relativity after                    independently studying the contents of Carroll, Sean M. (Dec.
            1997). Lecture Notes on General Relativity.
          * Analytically derived and worked through equations discussed in              de Rham, Claudia (Dec. 2014). Massive Gravity. In: 
            Living Reviews in Relativity
          * Working towards Black Hole solutions in Massive Gravity through             taking approximations and deriving the physical
            constraints. Will extend on the analyis performed in Rosen,                 Rachel A. (Oct. 2017). “Non-singular black holes in
            massive gravity: time-dependent solutions”. In: Journal of High             Energy Physics 2017.10, 206, p. 206
          * Studied theories of pulsars in Massive Gravity.

          * Developed code to assist with the analysis of camera trap data.             This data can be used to help with conservation efforts
            and biodiversity research. Supervised by Dr Marcus Rowcliffe
          * Created a GUI to increase the usability of programs dedicated to             analysing camera trap data using deep learning
            techniques. I worked in Python and Windows command prompt. This             is available through my GitHub.
          * Wrote code using OpenCV in python for image analysis studies,               specifically using background subtraction methods to
            help identify animals in camera trap images.
          * Created an interactive map using the Python package ’Leaflet’,              that explores the different species present in the Gobi
            desert.
          * Establishing the efficiency and accuracy of current camera trap             analysis programs by searching through metadata and
            creating a confusion matrix in R.
          * Conducted image and data analysis on camera trap images in R.
