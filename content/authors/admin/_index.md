Naomi McWilliam is a Master's student in Theoretical Physics at Imperial College London. Her research interests include Astronomy, specifically in exoplanet detection and stellar evolution. She also enjoys delving into more Theoretical studies in Black Holes and Neutron Stars. She is currently working on improving radial velocity precision in exoplanet detection, to characterise the masses of Earth-like exoplanets. She is also working on deriving black hole solutions analytically under the theory of Massive Gravity.
